# Antyfilter - Free Internet üêú

Antyfilter makes it easy to create effective VPN servers, giving anyone access to the open and free internet.

# Overview

Information plays an essential role in making the world a better place.

Blocking free flow of information hurts this process, as well as businesses and people in myriad ways.

Even worse, it is also being used to neutralise movements and protest of suppressed citizens.

# Why Antyfilter?

Antyfilter is an open ecosystem of verified and effective methods ready to setup to circumvent internet censorship in scale. It lets anyone create, run and share access to their own VPN.

Antyfilter uses continuous data streams from blocked regions to monitor internet censorship and develop new technologies suited for the moment, called **Blueprints**.

## Block resistant

Each blueprint uses unique technology and has a different use case. We are combining all these blueprints into [AntyProxy](https://github.com/Antyfilter/AntyProxy) for an easier setup and management.

## Community

Antyfilter has community with different roles so people with diverse knowledge, network, and capacities can work together to provide free access to internet.

Go to [Community repository](https://github.com/Antyfilter/Community) and participate in discussions on free internet access, censorship circumvention, and get help on our tools and platform.
